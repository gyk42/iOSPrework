# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) iOS Immersive: Pre-Course Assignment

Your pre-course assignment has three parts. Please complete ***all three parts*** before the first day of class:

## Pt. 1: Get the repo!
* Fork this pre-course repository (in GitHub, you can do this using the button on the top right that says "fork")
* Open the terminal!
* Using the command line, navigate into your `Documents` directory.
* Create a new folder called `Repositories` and then navigate into that.
* Create a sub-folder called `GA-iOS` and navigate into that.
* `Clone` your remote fork of this pre-course repository into your local "GA-iOS" folder by running the following command:
```git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/iOSI-precourse-onboarding.git```
* This will clone your fork of the pre-course repository onto your computer! Just make sure you've navigated to your local "GA-iOS" directory in the command line before running the `clone` command, or else you won't know where your local copy might end up!

* Note: Technically, you can accomplish all this using the Github website & desktop app, but we recommend that you use the command line instead.

## Pt. 2: Complete all of the `TODOs` in the [included Playground file](./PreWork.playground/Contents.swift)
* Open `PreWork.playground` in Xcode and use your new Swift knowledge to complete all of the `TODO` exercises.
* When you're finished, uncomment the test code at the bottom to check if your answers are valid!
* Make sure to **save** your file when you're finished.
* Use the command line to rename your file to `prework.[yourname].playground`

## Pt. 3: Start your first app!
* Create a new XCode project: a "Single View" iOS app. Do not use core data, unit tests, or UI tests.
* Name your app file like so: `[yourname]-precourse-app`
* To save it, navigate to your local `01-task` folder and save your file there.
* Next, navigate into "Main.storyboard" and add a picture of yourself, plus a label that says your name.
* Run the app and make sure that both show up! They do not have to be aligned particularly well, but they do need to show up.
* BONUS: For some bonus functionality, when you tap on your image in the app, make it navigate to a new screen that displays your image.

### Submission

Use your newfound terminal & git knowledge to submit your work!

1. Push your local edits up to your remote fork. This will copy your local files to your online github fork.
2. [Use the following form to send us the link to your fork, so we can review your materials!](http://goo.gl/forms/onJ8DOil8ftWYySJ2)

* Note: *Make sure you've re-titled your saved playground and app files with your full name!*


### Feedback

* **Playground File**: Students should use the inline error-checking and test code provided (uncomment the code at the bottom of the file) to review their work.
* **Single View App**: Students should submit their work to their course github repository.

Your instructors will use [the following rubric](./rubric.md) to score your pre-course project deliverables using the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, great job!_
